		<h3>Retrieving JSON results for an image search</h3><code>https://imgsrchapi.herokuapp.com/freecodecamp</code>
		<h4>Will retrieve a 10 item JSON object such as <a href='https://imgsrchapi.herokuapp.com/freecodecamp'>this</a></h4>
		<h4>Each item will have the following format:</h4><code>{"url":The URL of the image itself,"altText":The alternative text for the image,"thumbnail": URL to a thumbnail of the image as used by Google Image Search results,"context":The URL wherein the image was located by Google on the web}</code><br>
		<h3>Paginating through results</h3>
		<h4>Each search will yield up to 10 pages of results which may be paginated through</h4>
		<h4>Utilize the "offset" query in your search URL as follows:</h4><code>https://imgsrchapi.herokuapp.com/freecodecamp?offset=3</code>
		<h5>Note that entering an offset value greater than 10 or less than one will return the first page of results</h5>
